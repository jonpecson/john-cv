## üöÄ How to Create Your n8n Blog Post

### Step 1: Access Sanity Studio

The Sanity Studio should be running at `http://localhost:3333`. If not, run:

```bash
cd studio && pnpm dev
```

### Step 2: Create New Blog Post

1. Go to Sanity Studio
2. Click "Blog Post" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Create new document"
4. Fill in the basic information:
   - **Title**: "Tired of writing glue code? n8n gives developers an open-source automation platform"
   - **Slug**: `n8n-automation-platform-for-developers` (auto-generated)
   - **Published at**: Set to today's date
   - **Excerpt**: "Tired of writing glue code? n8n gives developers an open-source automation platform that integrates with your stack while keeping full control. Learn how to automate deployments, manage webhooks, and connect services like a pro."

### Step 3: Add Content with Code Blocks

In the "Body" field, you'll add content using the block editor. Here's how to structure your post:

#### Introduction (Normal Text)

Add a normal text block with your introduction paragraph.

#### Headings

Use H2 for main sections like "Why Developers Choose n8n" and "Advanced Features Devs Actually Use"

#### Code Blocks

For each code snippet, click the "+" button and select "Code Block":

**JavaScript Code Block:**

- Language: JavaScript
- Filename: `transform-api.js` (optional)
- Code:

```javascript
// Transform API responses before processing
return items.map((item) => ({
  ...item,
  timestamp: new Date(item.created_at).toISOString(),
}));
```

**Bash Code Block:**

- Language: Bash
- Filename: `trigger-workflow.sh` (optional)
- Code:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "X-N8N-API-KEY: your-key" \
https://your-n8n.io/workflow/webhook/abc123
```

#### Tables

For comparison tables or structured data, click the "+" button and select "Table":

**Example Table Structure:**

- Row 1: Header cells (check "Is Header" for each cell)
  - Cell 1: "Traditional Approach"
  - Cell 2: "n8n Approach"
- Row 2: Data cells
  - Cell 1: "API webhooks: Write Express servers"
  - Cell 2: "API webhooks: Drag-and-drop connectors"
- Row 3: Data cells
  - Cell 1: "Error handling: Manual try/catch blocks"
  - Cell 2: "Error handling: Visual retry flows"

#### Numbered Lists

For step-by-step instructions or ordered content:

1. Select text in the editor
2. Click the numbered list button (1. 2. 3.) in the toolbar
3. Or use the "/" command and select "Numbered list"

### Step 4: Complete Content Structure

Here's the recommended structure for your post:

1. **Introduction** (Normal text)
2. **Why Developers Choose n8n** (H2 heading)
   - Bullet points about benefits
3. **Advanced Features Devs Actually Use** (H2 heading)
   - **Code Nodes** (H3 heading)
   - JavaScript code block
   - **CLI & API Control** (H3 heading)
   - Bash code block
   - **Debugging** (H3 heading)
   - Normal text about debugging features
4. **Killer Use Cases for Dev Teams** (H2 heading)
   - **CI/CD Automation** (H3 heading)
   - Normal text describing the workflow
   - **Blockchain DevOps** (H3 heading)
   - Normal text describing use cases
   - **Database Sync** (H3 heading)
